# ToastNotificationScript
The Windows 10 Toast Notification Script enables you to create nice and nifty toast notifications for the logged on user in Windows 10.  
This script is a branch of Martin Bengtssons script found here, https://www.imab.dk/windows-10-toast-notification-script/ all credit to him for creating the whole system. My branch is a copy to work when using Windows 10 Servicing and getting the DynamicDeadline information from WMI.  
My changes will ofcourse be presented to Martin in case he want's to implement them in his sript as well.
